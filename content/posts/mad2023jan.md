## Intro

___

### Movie a Day (MaD)

Sometime late last year I decided to get serious with my media consumption. What started as an attempt to reconnect with my inner child (As a kid I'd often watch 10-15 movies a week) has become a welcome time sink as I settle into remote work.

I built a media server out of an old refurbished mini PC I had lying around (more on that in a future article) and started a Letterboxd [account](https://letterboxd.com/KayCalBee). It wasn't long before my watchlist exploded with 100s of movies and was growing daily!

### Guidelines

1. Manageability - Keep watchlist to 250 movies.
-

2. Availability - Make every movie available!
-

3. D-word - Record everything!

Good, not great.

I started the year off with *All My Friends Hate Me*, a delightful dark satire taking aim at millennial self-obsession.

Throughout the movie I found myself bouncing between laughing so hard I couldn't hear and pausing it so I can fully take in the ridiculous awkwardness of the situations. It does an excellent job at stoking very specific social anxieties, felt very familiar.

Production value's good too,

Unfortunately for all it does well it still feels, lacking. There is no satisfactory conclusion, no real light at the end of the awful tunnel. Pete never feels comfortable around his friends (and after that ending I doubt he ever will), his relationship is somewhat safe (but surely forever tarnished) and he's left just as confused and bewildered as the audience.

*dir - Masaaki Yuasa* / *wri - Tomihoko Morimi, Makoto Ueda*

Masaaki Yuasa is a genius.

*The Night is Short, Walk on Girl* is such a beautiful and refreshing movie it's like 

Each act is as smooth as a carefully crafted cocktail, my only complaint is that it weren't *longer*.

Yuasa's worlds are so warm and inviting

*dir - Jaume Collet-Serra* / *wri - Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, Sohrab Noshirvani*

Perhaps the biggest disappointment of my watchlist so far. My expectations were low and they somehow left me feeling cheated out of two hours.

*Black Adam* starts as normal superhero fare but quickly turns into a mess. With how long the role had been teased I'm not sure it was possible to live up to the hype.

There was a __LOT__ of slow motion, even for a 2022 superhero action movie.

I'm more interested in a Pierce Bronsan Dr. Fate movie, seriously what a waste of a nearly perfect casting.

The DC Cinematic Universe is a mess.

*"...Nothing but heartache."*
